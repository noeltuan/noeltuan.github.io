							<h3 class="major">What is Kundalini Yoga?</h3>
							<p>Kundalini Yoga is the Yoga of Awareness. Awareness is the active interaction of you as a finite individual identity with you as an infinite potential identity. This dormant energy of Awareness is in you.</p>
							<p>Kundalini Yoga is the supreme technology that systematically combines different yogic tools:
                <ul>
                  <li>Asana (posture)</li>
                  <li>Bandha (body lock)</li>
                  <li>Eye-Focus</li>
                  <li>Mantra (sound)</li>
                  <li>Meditation</li>
                  <li>Mudra (gesture)</li>
                  <li>Pranayama (breathe)</li>
                </ul>
              which works on the seven chakras, the arcline and the aura (the Eighth Chakra) to awaken that awareness and take you into your original Self.
              </p>
              <p>Kundalini Yoga promotes health, inner balance, mental clarity and vitality. Kundalini Yoga works directly on the total energy, teaching you to ride your energy, to experience it and penetrate any given situation to attain a balance. It is a natural unfolding of your own nature.</p>

              <h3 class="major">What is Kundalini Energy?</h3>
              <p>
                  Kundalini Energy is your creative potential.  It is the whole energy of the cosmos in the individual and beyond the individual. It is the energy of consciousness. Without the constant flow of that energy, you could not live. With a large flow, your mind begins to flow and awaken. When kundalini awakens, one understands the effect and impact of an action at the beginning of a sequence of action and reaction. He has the choice to take an action or not. In other words, a person becomes totally and wholly aware. It is the awakened inner identity of you.

              <h3 class="major">How does Kundalini Yoga compare to other types of yoga?</h3>
              <p>
                The difference between Kundalini Yoga and other forms of yoga is that Kundalini Yoga is direct and quick to raise the kundalini. It is said in the scriptures that Kundalini Yoga is the fastest way to create the transformation, the lightening and the enlightenment that each individual is seeking. It is the fastest way to establish an aligned relationship between the body, mind and the soul.
              </p>
              <p>
                There are over twenty-two major forms of the practice of yoga. Each one emphasizes some facet of the whole, like the facets on a diamond. Jappa Yoga, Shakti Yoga, Laya Yoga, Bhakti Yoga, Raja Yoga, and Hatha Yoga is part of Kundalini Yoga. Because Kundalini Yoga is the diamond itself, it gives greater leverage and transformative power than any one facet can. If you try to understand the entire diamond from any one facet, you’ll find yourself with a very shallow and incomplete understanding.

              <h3 class="major">Why Teach Kundalini Yoga by Yogi Bhajan®?</h3>
							<p>
                Since 2009, I have been practicing various forms of Yoga that includes Acro, Ashtanga, Forrest, Hatha, Hot, Restorative, Universal, Vinyasa, Yin and more. It felt good, but at the same time, beyond the asana, breathing and stretching, I felt something was missing. There has to be more to Yoga than what I was being taught!
              </p>
              <p>
                In 2016, I had a strong desire to add more consciousness and spirituality into the world and I was hoping to do it through Yoga. However, the guidance from the Akashic Records was very clear. No. Not now and not the forms of Yoga that I have been exposed to.
              </p>
              <p>
                In 2017, I attended my first Kundalini Yoga by Yogi Bhajan’s class. It was a special class to celebrate Yogi Bhajan’s birthday. It was not physically demanding and I was clueless to the mantras that was being chanted. I thought nothing of it.
              </p>
              <p>
                A month after, with the guidance of the Akashic Records, I gave Kundalini Yoga a second try. This was a full proper class. At the end of the class, I was buzzing at a high. I knew that Kundalini Yoga, the Yoga of Awareness, a technology of human consciousness is what I have been looking for and the Akashic Records confirmed so.
              </p>
              <p>
                In 2018, I started my Kundalini Yoga Teacher Training in Singapore. Coincidently, the second day of teacher’s training was Yogi Bhajan’s birthday! It has been exactly a year from when I first experienced it and now there I was training to become a teacher.
              </p>
              <p>
                Today, I am a certified Kundalini Yoga Teacher. Like everything else, the experiencing and learning never stops. Kundalini Yoga by Yogi Bhajan has taught me so much and I now share the teachings and technology to you. Contact me if you would like to attend a class or to find out more!
