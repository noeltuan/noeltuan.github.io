								The reason I asked Noel to give me an Akashic Records consultation, was my wish to connect with the Universe and my spiritual guides about important choice in my life related to work. I had many options and some fears and expectation related to them. I also had questions for my love life.
								<br /><br />
								I trusted Noel immediately when I first met him. During the session, Noel read my Akashic Records and he gave me very valuable information, helping me a lot. Although some information was not nice to know or sad, other things made me feel more relax about my future work or made me really happy. I was confirmed in my feeling about my partner being a partner for life!

								Noel is such a gifted, loving and vibrating soul!!!!
								<br /><br />
								Before I was blessed to have an Akashic Records reading with Noel, I met him at a cafe together with other friends. 
								<br /><br />
								At that time, I was having personal challenges. I felt extremely vulnerable and I couldn't stop crying in the middle of the group conversation. Noel was holding such a safe and loving space for me to let my tears flow even though that was our first meeting. 
								<br /><br />
								There was no shallow sympathy but his strong yet zen energy inside was REAL.
								<br /><br />
								When it comes to spiritual consultations, I honestly prefer women facilitators just because I am a woman and have been devoted to mystical dancing for a long time. But for the very first time, I felt very comfortable with a male practitioner and I decided to take his Akashic Records reading.
								<br /><br />
								The Akashic Records sounded familiar but I had no concrete idea what it was about. Noel gave me clear guidance before we started. The reading itself was totally different (almost opposite) from what I was thinking of doing but I guess this is what the Akashic Records is about. I feel that it has opened a new door for "spiritual growth" and I am very grateful for him guiding me to the path. I am sure as I walk in my journey, I will come back to Noel to keep listening to my higher self and humbly receive wisdom.
								<br /><br />
								Thank you, Noel!

								Like a messenger from heaven, Noel came into my life at a time when I needed answers the most. It was no coincidence that he came into my life when he did, and it's no coincidence that you're reading this now.
								<br /><br />
								If you are open and ready, you will find exactly what you're looking for. All you have to do is ask. This is how my reading went:
								<br /><br />
								Before my reading, I was excited and just a little bit nervous. I knew this was a significant opportunity to get answers to the burning questions I had about my life. I was running over all the questions in my mind to get the most out of the session as possible, and I was preparing myself to accept every answer I'd receive, good or bad.
								<br /><br />
								<em>(To get the most out of your session:
										<br /><br />
										Have a list of questions ready, questions that are meaningful to you and your life, whatever they may be. And be prepared for the possibility of getting through all of them, or getting through only one.
										<br /><br />
										Be as specific with each question as possible.)</em>
								<br /><br />
								To start the reading, Noel led me through a meditation that caused any anxiety to disappear and left me incredibly centered, comfortable, and calm.
								<br /><br />
								After the meditation, I was allowed to start asking questions. I was so calm and centered that I held the silence for a few more moments, so Noel started by speaking about my life, about the phase of life I was in and what was most important for me to know and do, without me having said a single word.
								<br /><br />
								Every bit of it was true and accurate, and there was no way he could have made this up with this himself. This confirmed that the answers were not coming from him, but from a different source.
								<br /><br />
								So I asked my questions, one after another, gaining clarity and insight with each answer received.
								<br /><br />
								By the end of the session, I was simply amazed at how clearly I knew where to take my life from there. To my surprise, I received answers to all my most important questions, and I was even able to ask questions I didn't think we would have time for.
								<br /><br />
								In the days following the reading, events foreshadowed in the reading occurred just as I was told they would. There’s no doubt in my mind that this is the real deal - if you are even the tiniest bit interested in a consultation, you should absolutely do it.
								<br /><br />
								But even if you don't do this now, keep it in the back of your mind. And when you or someone you know needs it, you will know where to go for answers.

								I had the privilege of having 2 reading with Noel, and they were both unique and incredible experiences.
								<br /><br />
								From my first reading, I got, not what I wanted, but what I needed.
								<br /><br />
								Through Noel, the Masters were able to really communicate exactly what I needed to do in order to get out of a lot of toxicity and unnecessary pain I was dealing with in my life. 
								<br /><br />
								I received the direction required for me to grow and expand towards my higher good. Everything said made sense and I knew that it was what I needed to hear in order to really take responsibility for how things were going until now in several relationships that were not working, including the relationship I had built with myself.
								<br /><br />
								The deepest message I got was that I was loved, that the angels and the masters were always by my side, whether I believed it or not. From that moment, so much started shifting in my life.
								<br /><br />
								The morning after, while doing my yoga practice, I felt the presence of the angels next to me and I knew I was not alone and I was being take care of. Their presence still remains by my side and whenever I feel weak or lonely, I remember Noel's words and I immediately feel peace in my heart. 
								<br /><br />
								I feel loved, I feel save and I feel taken cared of at all time by the divine and the masters. That is the biggest gift for me, as in the past I felt abandoned and alone for a long long time, and this brought a lot of sadness and pain to me. There is a new joy in my life now, and I know it came thanks to Noel's reading and revelations.  
								<br /><br />
								From my second reading, I got a lot of clarity regarding which exact steps would benefit the most my career and my spiritual growth. All my questions and concerns were specifically addressed and that allowed me to focus on what I needed to do in order to apply my talents and not waste time and energy in things that do not benefit me or would make a huge difference in my life. 
								<br /><br />
								Noel made me feel save, loved and in peace during the whole process and I am very grateful for his readings and for Noel :)

								Moreover, he offered amazingly helpful advice and solutions to the problems, opening a new horizon in a very unique way. It is so unbelievable that he is very connected and can read the past, current and future of someone with one's permission.

							<br /><br /><strong>Looking back now, Noel helped give me a new perspective on things that I was struggling to understand in one of the most darkest, emotional periods of my life.</strong>
							<br /><br />
							He turned my feelings of confusion around and gave me a sense of clarity and strength. 
							<br /><br />
							He created a safe space and delivered the messages in a caring and nurturing way. I got so much valuable messages and guidance during our sessions. He was so accurate on what was going on in my life with his descriptions of specific situations. His gifted sense of feelings and emotions literally made me gasp. The readings have helped me to understand what next steps to take. I felt a deeper knowing about what my purpose is and which direction I need to go next. 
							<br /><br />
							It was the sweetest kind of encouragements from the Masters I could have hoped for, and I love that I can listen to the recordings of our sessions whenever I need a bit of a pick-me-up as I work towards my goals. I am looking forward to the new excitements, challenges and learning opportunities ahead of me. 
							<br /><br />
							I thank you with all my heart.

								I have known Noel for more than 11 years of my life. I have seen him through his ups, downs and have been blessed enough to witness firsthand his spiritual growth, development and transformation.
								<br /><br />
								Noel is an excellent reader and therapist. Being a reader and “healer” myself, I acknowledge the purity of his intentions, integrity, values, advice, suggestions and readings. He is extremely dedicated towards serving the Highest Good of the collective and sees the best and beauty in every being.
								<br /><br />
								<strong>I found his Tarot card readings (combined with the Akashic Records) extremely accurate and elucidating.</strong> He is very often able to address the Heart of my situations and provide insight, Wisdom and clarity on all matters I enquire about. I am privy to his behind-the-scenes process to each Reading report he types up – some take him 2-3 hours long as he takes his time to get centered, channel and then return to his original writings to see if any thing needs to be altered. This patience, dedication, integrity and fidelity towards purity of messages channeled is a rare trait to find in spiritual or therapeutic healers/facilitators today. So I can say with certainty, Noel is a reader you can rely on to be there for you even after readings and one whom you can trust intimately.
								<br /><br />
								Side note to readers: Engage him on matters relating to Tantra. I found our conversations and talks extremely enlightening and knowledgeable.

								Noel has a kindness and gentleness as well as a sense of focus that brings immediacy to the readings. He knows how to help you ask for what it is you need (rather than getting lost in the details). And at the same time, when the reading requires further clarification, he is able and willing to go an extra mile -- even days after the reading to make sure that you can benefit fully.
								<br /><br />
								For me, the reading was most helpful in clarifying my own needs at this time and where to focus my efforts. This has greatly helped me in my work providing more joy, focus and simplicity. I had simply been feeling overwhelmed and not knowing where to begin nor where to follow through. I think thanks to the gentle guidance, I am on to something original that can contribute to the joy of others.
								<br /><br />
								Some of what I heard in the reading was not necessarily what I wanted to hear (health wise) but Noel helped to keep me open to it without any bias nor wishing to push me in any direction. I think that takes a certain gifted person to do that and I am most grateful at the extra mile and all the work and follow up that he did after to make sure I was ok with my decision and understood what it might entail. Especially, since my surgeon called me the next day and asked me to turn around at the last minute (this time it showed my flexibility!).  
								<br /><br />
								In the end, like Noel points out. Our future changes. We should not be stuck on a reading, even the one done recently. We need to be open to the possibilities of the moment and able to live with the consequences of the path we chose.
								<br /><br />
								This man clearly loves what he does and gives his full self to the service of others. I can recommend him highly and I am most grateful for him sharing his gifts.

								Noel is a trusted Akashic Records reader who provides a safe space. As a complete novice to the readings, I had several questions that Noel very patiently explained.
								<br /><br />
								Despite a last minute request for a reading, he was also willing to accommodate to my schedule. The reading was conducted in a nonjudgmental and compassionate manner, and allowed for further questions to be brought up.
								<br /><br />
								Beyond the readings, Noel also gave notes of advice as an outsider with clearer perspective. Grateful for knowing him and much appreciation to the help rendered!

									I had the most illuminating session with Noel which cleared the fog in my head that had weighed on my mind for months. I was most impressed that he was able to immediately identify the issues & questions that were on my mind without me voicing anything aloud; we started in session in quiet meditation, he then let me know my records were ready to be read and immediately started talking.
									<br /><br />
									<strong>EVERYTHING he said was right on point</strong> -- the vision presented was clear and gave me immense clarity & confidence on the big decisions that I'll be making. I'm grateful for the session and want to say a big thank you for sharing your gift of reading the Akashic Records.

									An amazing session that pinpointed exactly what was going on in my life and told me what I needed to do to move forward. Sometimes you know subconsciously but need that guidance to push you forward. That’s what the session has done for me. The tingling sensation as I delved into my records was unexpected and I hope it helps me to expand. Thank you for an enlightening session.

									Had a very eye-opening session with Noel, and would definitely recommend it to anyone, even for those who are not sure if they believe in this sort of thing, for I didn't really believe at first either. From the very start, I could see that Noel was a very genuine person, and completely up front. I was very surprised that he knew (the moment my Akashic Records was opened) exactly why I was there to see him. He knew the issues I was facing, and a rough summary of how my problems had unfolded thus far. His perspective of my 'mistakes' was also a very loving and forgiving one, which made me trust him further.
									<br /><br />
									Had a remarkable session with him, and some really good life advise. I feel sooo much better after the consultation, with a greater sense of direction and purpose. I guess this is the most important thing a person should have in life, purpose. Noel even encouraged me to start learning about the Akashic Records myself, in an effort to know myself better. Definitely a life changing experience, very positive, and eye opening. I even got my girlfriend to have a consultation with him. 
									<br /><br />
									I highlight recommend Noel to anyone who is looking for guidance, to develop and better themselves.

								My session with Noel has changed my life. I received strong and clear guidance on my current life situations and direction. Some of the answers were not what my ego wanted to hear at the time, but I felt that deep down I probably did agree that they supported my highest good.
								<br /><br />
								It has been over a month since the session, during which time I took action based on the guidance received (re relationships, health, personal growth, etc.) and I am very happy today with the way life is unfolding for me.
								<br /><br />
								Noel was highly professional and sensitive throughout the session and I would highly recommend him to anyone seeking to access guidance from their Akashic Records.

								I did an Akashic Records reading with Noel at a really rough time of my life. Although tough to hear, it confirmed what I already knew in my heart and gave me more clarity and strength to make the decisions I needed to make.
								<br /><br />
								I was advised of some key blocks I had which were causing problems in my relationships and I found this incredibly useful going forward, as it gave me awareness of the areas I needed to work on.
								<br /><br />
								The reading also helped to open my mind to new possibilities on my path which I had not previously considered and this helped to shape the next six months of my life. Noel is a kind soul who exudes strength and love, and I highly recommend him for a reading.

								The session was useful and gave me the clarity and guidance that I needed on my questions. I found your pre-session with the form giving the details, useful.  Gave me ideas on the questions that I can ask, which was helpful.  
								<br /><br />
								During and after the session, I found the messages comforting.  The advice given was clear and insightful.  I found Noel was coming from a peaceful and balanced state and so the messages resonated with that energy.  There was hope and it was empowering with constructive feedback on the difficulties and how I can do well to overcome obstacles.  On the whole, encouraging and comforting.
