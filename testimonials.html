								Like a messenger from heaven, Noel came into my life at a time when I needed answers the most. It was no coincidence that he came into my life when he did, and it's no coincidence that you're reading this now.
								<br /><br />
								If you are open and ready, you will find exactly what you're looking for. All you have to do is ask. This is how my reading went:
								<br /><br />
								Before my reading, I was excited and just a little bit nervous. I knew this was a significant opportunity to get answers to the burning questions I had about my life. I was running over all the questions in my mind to get the most out of the session as possible, and I was preparing myself to accept every answer I'd receive, good or bad.
								<br /><br />
								<em>(To get the most out of your session:
										<br /><br />
										Have a list of questions ready, questions that are meaningful to you and your life, whatever they may be. And be prepared for the possibility of getting through all of them, or getting through only one.
										<br /><br />
										Be as specific with each question as possible.)</em>
								<br /><br />
								To start the reading, Noel led me through a meditation that caused any anxiety to disappear and left me incredibly centered, comfortable, and calm.
								<br /><br />
								After the meditation, I was allowed to start asking questions. I was so calm and centered that I held the silence for a few more moments, so Noel started by speaking about my life, about the phase of life I was in and what was most important for me to know and do, without me having said a single word.
								<br /><br />
								Every bit of it was true and accurate, and there was no way he could have made this up with this himself. This confirmed that the answers were not coming from him, but from a different source.
								<br /><br />
								So I asked my questions, one after another, gaining clarity and insight with each answer received.
								<br /><br />
								By the end of the session, I was simply amazed at how clearly I knew where to take my life from there. To my surprise, I received answers to all my most important questions, and I was even able to ask questions I didn't think we would have time for.
								<br /><br />
								In the days following the reading, events foreshadowed in the reading occurred just as I was told they would. There’s no doubt in my mind that this is the real deal - if you are even the tiniest bit interested in a consultation, you should absolutely do it.
								<br /><br />
								But even if you don't do this now, keep it in the back of your mind. And when you or someone you know needs it, you will know where to go for answers.

								Noel surprised me with mysteriously being able to accurately understand and empathize the happenings in my life. I felt lost and painful towards life and was "trying my luck " with Tarot Cards via the Akashic Records. His answers were extremely accurate in interpreting my current situation.
								<br /><br />
								<strong>Without telling him a word about my current situation, he managed to tell what my exact issues are.</strong>
								<br /><br />
								Moreover, he offered amazingly helpful advice and solutions to the problems, opening a new horizon in a very unique way. It is so unbelievable that he is very connected and can read the past, current and future of someone with one's permission. I really appreciate his help and with the guidance of the Akashic Records, my life turned clearer and better. Highly recommended!!

								I had the privilege of having 2 reading with Noel, and they were both unique and incredible experiences.
								<br /><br />
								From my first reading, I got, not what I wanted, but what I needed.
								<br /><br />
								Through Noel, the Masters were able to really communicate exactly what I needed to do in order to get out of a lot of toxicity and unnecessary pain I was dealing with in my life. 
								<br /><br />
								I received the direction required for me to grow and expand towards my higher good. Everything said made sense and I knew that it was what I needed to hear in order to really take responsibility for how things were going until now in several relationships that were not working, including the relationship I had built with myself.
								<br /><br />
								The deepest message I got was that I was loved, that the angels and the masters were always by my side, whether I believed it or not. From that moment, so much started shifting in my life.
								<br /><br />
								The morning after, while doing my yoga practice, I felt the presence of the angels next to me and I knew I was not alone and I was being take care of. Their presence still remains by my side and whenever I feel weak or lonely, I remember Noel's words and I immediately feel peace in my heart. 
								<br /><br />
								I feel loved, I feel save and I feel taken cared of at all time by the divine and the masters. That is the biggest gift for me, as in the past I felt abandoned and alone for a long long time, and this brought a lot of sadness and pain to me. There is a new joy in my life now, and I know it came thanks to Noel's reading and revelations.  
								<br /><br />
								From my second reading, I got a lot of clarity regarding which exact steps would benefit the most my career and my spiritual growth. All my questions and concerns were specifically addressed and that allowed me to focus on what I needed to do in order to apply my talents and not waste time and energy in things that do not benefit me or would make a huge difference in my life. 
								<br /><br />
								Noel made me feel save, loved and in peace during the whole process and I am very grateful for his readings and for Noel :)

							I had two readings with Noel, and they were like gifts from spirits.
							<br /><br />
							I am writing this testimonial three months after the readings.
							
							<br /><br /><strong>Looking back now, Noel helped give me a new perspective on things that I was struggling to understand in one of the most darkest, emotional periods of my life.</strong>
							<br /><br />
							He turned my feelings of confusion around and gave me a sense of clarity and strength. 
							<br /><br />
							He created a safe space and delivered the messages in a caring and nurturing way. I got so much valuable messages and guidance during our sessions. He was so accurate on what was going on in my life with his descriptions of specific situations. His gifted sense of feelings and emotions literally made me gasp. The readings have helped me to understand what next steps to take. I felt a deeper knowing about what my purpose is and which direction I need to go next. 
							<br /><br />
							It was the sweetest kind of encouragements from the Masters I could have hoped for, and I love that I can listen to the recordings of our sessions whenever I need a bit of a pick-me-up as I work towards my goals. I am looking forward to the new excitements, challenges and learning opportunities ahead of me. 
							<br /><br />
							I thank you with all my heart.

								I felt curious and eager to have a session with Noel.  Right from the beginning I sensed he was highly connected and aligned for the best outcome of the session.  The information I received from the session made a lot of sense and resonated deeply in myself.  I believe Noel is a lightful and truthful compassionate professional that helps others to better travel their inner journey.  I am fully convinced that having soul level information allows me to be more aligned and confident in my life, thank you Noel.

								Noel is such a gifted, loving and vibrating soul!!!!
								<br /><br />
								Before I was blessed to have an Akashic Records reading with Noel, I met him at a cafe together with other friends. 
								<br /><br />
								At that time, I was having personal challenges. I felt extremely vulnerable and I couldn't stop crying in the middle of the group conversation. Noel was holding such a safe and loving space for me to let my tears flow even though that was our first meeting. 
								<br /><br />
								There was no shallow sympathy but his strong yet zen energy inside was REAL.
								<br /><br />
								When it comes to spiritual consultations, I honestly prefer women facilitators just because I am a woman and have been devoted to mystical dancing for a long time. But for the very first time, I felt very comfortable with a male practitioner and I decided to take his Akashic Records reading.
								<br /><br />
								The Akashic Records sounded familiar but I had no concrete idea what it was about. Noel gave me clear guidance before we started. The reading itself was totally different (almost opposite) from what I was thinking of doing but I guess this is what the Akashic Records is about. I feel that it has opened a new door for "spiritual growth" and I am very grateful for him guiding me to the path. I am sure as I walk in my journey, I will come back to Noel to keep listening to my higher self and humbly receive wisdom.
								<br /><br />
								Thank you, Noel!

								I have known Noel for more than 11 years of my life. I have seen him through his ups, downs and have been blessed enough to witness firsthand his spiritual growth, development and transformation.
								<br /><br />
								Noel is an excellent reader and therapist. Being a reader and “healer” myself, I acknowledge the purity of his intentions, integrity, values, advice, suggestions and readings. He is extremely dedicated towards serving the Highest Good of the collective and sees the best and beauty in every being.
								<br /><br />
								<strong>I found his Tarot card readings (combined with the Akashic Records) extremely accurate and elucidating.</strong> He is very often able to address the Heart of my situations and provide insight, Wisdom and clarity on all matters I enquire about. I am privy to his behind-the-scenes process to each Reading report he types up – some take him 2-3 hours long as he takes his time to get centered, channel and then return to his original writings to see if any thing needs to be altered. This patience, dedication, integrity and fidelity towards purity of messages channeled is a rare trait to find in spiritual or therapeutic healers/facilitators today. So I can say with certainty, Noel is a reader you can rely on to be there for you even after readings and one whom you can trust intimately.
								<br /><br />
								Side note to readers: Engage him on matters relating to Tantra. I found our conversations and talks extremely enlightening and knowledgeable.

								Noel’s akashic reading was very informative and incredibly useful. The process is really smooth and effortless as he guides himself to a place where he channels any information that you require - about your job, your location, your health, your love life, your relationships, any blocks you have.. the guidance I received was very important for me and I left with a new sense of purpose and a direction that I trusted, not to mention a spring in my step. A very worthwhile process if you need to consult the higher realms about key decisions or events in your life. Thank you Noel!

								Noel’s Akashic Record session was very well guided with explanation and preparing one to be relaxed to slowly gets into the flow of the session.
								<br /><br />
								Very much based on neutrality and channeled what he perceived from the energy that he picked up in the questionings that one have.
								<br /><br />
								My session was exactly what I sensed and he picked it up intuitively, merely reflected back to me what I already know and affirmed my conclusions about my path in that moment.
								Insightful and beautiful light at the same time.

								The session was useful and gave me the clarity and guidance that I needed on my questions. I found your pre-session with the form giving the details, useful.  Gave me ideas on the questions that I can ask, which was helpful.  
								<br />
								During and after the session, I found the messages comforting.  The advice given was clear and insightful.  I found Noel was coming from a peaceful and balanced state and so the messages resonated with that energy.  There was hope and it was empowering with constructive feedback on the difficulties and how I can do well to overcome obstacles.  On the whole, encouraging and comforting.
