								Through working with the Akashic Records, I was guided to delve into Breathwork, Tantric and Tao practices for my personal healing of sexual dysfunction and trauma, to deepen my exploration of intimacy and sexuality and to release stagnant emotions. My healing was profound! No more sexual dysfunction! Emotions and trauma were released and I found deep intimacy and sexuality in my relationship. I felt alive, liberated and open!
							</p>
							<p>
								Through my self-healing I was guided by the Akashic Records to act as their physical proxy. To learn Breathwork, Tantric and Tao modalities to assist others in their rediscovery of their True Self. Akashic Bodywork was born.
							</p>
							<p>

									Noel is a sensitive, but powerful bodywork practitioner. He provided me with a singularly unique full-body experience that was beyond my expectation. As a straight male, I have not had such an intimate experience with another man, and I found that such deep connection without sexual underpinnings had a distinctly divine quality. It felt as though we were able to transcend our biological identities and become something closer to pure being. To clarify, this was a clothes-on massage without touching of genitalia.
									<br /><br />
									I wish all massages were like this. I left the session feeling a degree of sensation I haven't experienced since I was young. I felt vulnerable, giddy, and very much alive. Thanks Noel for helping dislodge my physical blockages and come into closer union with my own body.

									I am writing this testimonial very late but I really appreciate how Noel made it extremely safe for me to express my emotions. I had been following Noel for quite a while and something was calling out to me to get a session from him as his name kept popping up. From the start, I felt safe in his presence. This is coming from someone who had trust issues with the opposite gender and would research extensively to make sure that the healer is in integrity--and Noel is totally someone who is trustworthy and reliable.  
									<br /><br />
									I also used to have problems with expressing myself in such a vulnerable way but never was there a moment when I felt that it was unsafe for me, especially given the history that I had issues feeling safe in this world.
									<br /><br />
									At the start, Noel guided me into doing the moving meditation and I always felt awkward about moving intuitively or following my intuition, and even more so to express my emotions, but he made it extremely safe for me to feel. He could feel my nervousness and tension which is something that sometimes I couldn't feel it myself because that was almost an automatic state of being for me having lived through almost an entire of turbulence and instability.
									<br /><br />
									During the session, I was able to release some of the stored emotions and Noel was a great support with the loving and safe container he held. I am very thankful for Noel's patience for allowing my expression of vulnerability during the session as he held space for me.
									<br /><br />
									I could feel a lot of things moving the following months after the session, I had shifts that happened for me even when I didn't do anything in particular in terms of healing but things were happening that I needed to address and I knew it happened for the reason of healing. I am really extremely grateful and would encourage anyone to get a session from Noel.

									I would recommend Noel as he was excellent to work with and very professional. Noel takes the comfort and objectives of his client very seriously, and listens closely to what the issues are, and offers realistic feedback on what can be achieved. You do get the sense that it is a partnership, and it is very easy to place your trust in having Noel push for progress and breakthroughs with you.
									<br /><br />
									Throughout the session, I felt his kindness, love, and genuine care for me, and this has continued even after the session with Noel checking in on any feelings and developments since. I really enjoyed working with him, and will be looking to have a further session with him again in the coming months.
