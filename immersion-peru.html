                <h4>Calista Goh</h4>
                <p>
                  Calista is an international Akashic Records consultant, teacher and healer. Born into a maternal lineage of medicine women, psychics and intuitives, Calista was exposed from a young age to oracle readings, soul mid-wifery and death.
                  <br /><br />
                  She grew up in an environment where violence, abuse and isolation were her norm. Having experienced starvation, poverty, loss, grief and PTSD for the most part of her 20s has imbued in Calista a deep respect for integrity, empathy and compassion, igniting in her a passion (with personal experience) in the healing arts, therapy work and philanthropic activities. Calista was formerly intiated into Service after several near-death and real-death experiences throughout her late teens to 30s. She returns each time from the “Other Side” to share deeper Wisdom, fuller Love and expanded Joy to everyone she is blessed and honoured to meet. She travels around the world offering her services in Asia, UK, Europe, Morocco, Guatemala and USA. Her clients include celebrities and high-powered executives.
                  <br /><br />
                  Calista has trained with esteemed Tibetan/Himalayan Masters (H.H Dalai Lama, H.H. Gyalwang Drukpa, H.E. Ayang Rinpoche), entheogens/psychedelics, a dying pigeon, her Navajo and Mayan ancestors, Nature, the Elementals and Hermeticism. Calista’s methods include a mix of psychotherapy, Akashic Records, shamanic techniques, yoga, dance, psychic channelling, crystal healing, sound, vibrational medicine, food and nutrition, breathwork and more. Calista is also a trained Cacao Ceremony Facilitator and a budding astrologer.
                  <br /><br />
                  She believes Love is the strongest Medicine and shares herself fully in that sense. An artist, dancer, writer and designer at heart, Calista is also legally trained, a psychotherapist and serial entrepreneur. Her partner and her are passionate about permaculture, intentional communities and reconnecting humans back with Nature through experiences and trips.
                  <br /><br />
                  She is currently in training with maestros in the use and wisdom of Master Plants and entheogens. Mapacho (Sacred Tobacco) and Ayahuasca are dear to her heart.

                <h4>Claire Eli</h4>
                <p>
                  Claire Eli is a movement, dance, yoga and meditation teacher who loves to explore the world through the body.
                  <br /><br />
                  After experiencing the aftermath of sexual assault in her early teens, her body was numb. Logically she understood the impact of trauma, but she did not realise the extent to which it had crept into every part of her life. Over the past decade, yoga, dance, and meditation has allowed Claire to change her path, express herself, confront fears, and experience a sense of freedom that she always knew was there but did not know how to reach.
                  <br /><br />
                  Claire’s journey has sparked a fascination with movement and self-discovery sending her around the globe. She has been fortunate enough to learn from many amazing teachers and mentors; teach in top studios, community centres, and health & wellness retreats; work with elite athletes, corporations, and people from all walks of life. Her experience has taken her to the UK, New York, South East Asia, Central America and Australasia. Initially studying in Greece with the US based school SYI School Yoga Institute, Claire went on to train between Spain and London with Frog Lotus Yoga and has taken additional trainings in Forrest Yoga and Tantra with The International School of Temple Arts. In 2018 Claire completed the International Study program at Peridance Capezio Dance School in New York and is currently completing an apprenticeship in the Rythmetrics Method, (mixed martial arts and dance), with her teacher Sekou Heru in New York.
                  <br /><br />
                  She has partaken in S.N. Goenka Vipassana and has studied Buddhist mindfulness meditation techniques from teachers across India and Cambodia. Furthermore, she has gained valuable insight from working with shamanic practices and plant medicines in both the UK, Spain and Guatemala. Claire is passionate about connecting students to the wisdom held in their own body and encourages people to move from a place of inner strength, ease and curiosity.
                  <br /><br />
                  Her classes are inclusive and she welcomes those of all levels to join in. Claire is currently based between New York and Spain.

              <div class="content">
                <h4>Noel Tuan</h4>
                <p>
                  Since 2017, Noel has dedicated his life to the Akashic Records and the upliftment of Consciousness. An evergreen learner, he travels around the world learning from various teachers including H.H. Dalai Lama and Sadhguru, expanding his experience, heart and wisdom. Noel loves sharing his craft as an Akashic Records Bodyworker, Consultant, Educator and Kundalini Yoga Teacher.
                  <br /><br />
                  When Noel was 11, the divorce of his parents left him hurt and emotionally traumatized. To deal with his pain, he focused all of his attention to what he thought as doing well in life. He became a machine, numbed of emotions. He topped his standard in school, won in amateur boxing, hip-hop competitive dance and middle-distance running. Noel also took on numerous leadership positions that included serving in the army (with over 100 men under him). Believing that money was the proof of success, he became an Investment Banker, climbing the corporate ladder very quickly. He was the fastest to make Associate Director in HSBC Hong Kong and later Director in RBC Hong Kong. He also co-founded an internationally acclaimed organic raw vegan superfood snacks manufacturing business. However, despite all these accolades and material success, Noel could not find any meaning in all that he did or accomplished.
                  <br /><br />
                  In 2014, Noel’s life transformed. He discovered the Akashic Records and his spiritual calling. Through working with the Akashic Records, he became in touch with his emotions, found his purpose, opened his doors to intimacy and sexuality, and realized Universal Oneness. The Akashic Records also guided him to learn various modalities that includes Breathwork and Tapping for his personal growth and to support others.
                  <br /><br />
                  Noel traverses the material and spiritual with equanimity and grace. Through the Akashic Records, he has helped people from all walks of life discover balance, that includes Forbes-listed CEO, trauma victims and other holistic workers. He specializes in intimacy and sexual issues for all genders, using tantra-tao techniques. He loves working with breath, meditation, movement, sound and touch. Noel might not have all the answers, but knows that the Akashic Records does.

                <h3>Where will the retreat be held?</h3>
                <p>
                  Nestled in an oasis of native plants, fruit trees and a magnificent waterfall, Munay Sonqo is a place to connect to the incredible depth and beauty of all that nature offers.
                  <br /><br />
                  The Sacred Valley of Peru, where the retreat is located, is a majestic spot in the Andes Mountains and home of the twelve mountains known as “Apus” — “luminous beings” who are said to intercede on behalf of people. Those who come to Munay Sonqo have the opportunity to commune directly with these mountains, as well as with the local curanderos and pacos (healers), who engage with us for ritual and ceremony. Munay Sonqo believes our world today benefits greatly from contact with these ancient sites, cultures and ways.
                  <br /><br />
                  Munay Sonqo has programs ranging from yoga and other practices, to personal healing and reflection and practical workshops on Permaculture.
                  <br /><br />
                  Guests at Munay Sonqo Retreat and Yoga Center are served delicious meals with locally-grown and lovingly prepared ingredients.
                  <br /><br />
                  Each guest room is a reflection of the Peruvian culture of the Sacred Valley. Thanks to their staff, the entire center embodies the kindness, love and wholeness that permeates this magical place.
