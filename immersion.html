                <h3>Who will be teaching you?</h3>
                <p>
                  Prior to 2017, Noel Tuan held many titles. Boxer, Computer Engineer, Dancer, Entrepreneur, Health & Fitness Instructor, Investment Banker, Runner. In 2017, Noel became a full time Akashic Records Consultant, dedicating his life's vocation to support others in their transformational spiritual journey.
                  <br /><br />
                  In September 2018, while journaling in the Akashic Records during a retreat in Chiang Mai, Thailand, he got the Divine Message to teach others how to access the Akashic Records. 
                  <br /><br />
                  He was doubtful. Was this coming from his ego? Noel was in tears, touched from the honor and trust that came from the Akashic Records but at the same time he felt afraid and unready. Who was he to teach such sacred work? After repeated confirmations from the Akashic Records, he went into recluse to deepen his experience, inner work and research on the Akashic Records.
                  <br /><br />
                  Ready, Noel now shares his knowledge, experience and wisdom with you. If you would like to learn more of his story, <a href="./about">click here</a>.
