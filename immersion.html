                <h3>Who will be teaching you?</h3>
                <p>
                  Prior to 2017, Noel Tuan held many titles. Boxer, Computer Engineer, Dancer, Entrepreneur, Health & Fitness Instructor, Investment Banker, Runner. In 2017, Noel became a full time Akashic Records Consultant, dedicating his life's vocation to support others in their transformational spiritual journey.
                  <br /><br />
                  In September 2018, while journaling in the Akashic Records during a retreat in Chiang Mai, Thailand, he got the Divine Message to teach others how to access the Akashic Records. 
                  <br /><br />
                  He was doubtful. Was this coming from his ego? Noel was in tears, touched from the honor and trust that came from the Akashic Records but at the same time he felt afraid and unready. Who was he to teach such sacred work? After repeated confirmations from the Akashic Records, he went into recluse to deepen his experience, inner work and research on the Akashic Records.
                  <br /><br />
                  Ready, Noel now shares his knowledge, experience and wisdom with you. If you would like to learn more of his story, <a href="./about">click here</a>.

                It was by pure chance or destiny that I would have signed up for the retreat. I merely wanted a getaway from the family/kids because I needed a break.
                <br /><br />
                I went in anxious but relaxed after the first night. Once lessons started, I felt right at ease like I was meant to be there. I did not expect to learn about spirituality but was merely curious to see what my Akashic Records might be like, and if following the path of being a healer was the path for me.
                <br /><br />
                I got more than I expected, having gained insights from my Akashic Records, and strangely after the retreat, my relationships with my family, especially my mum have vastly improved, simply because of what I learned about our past lives.
                <br /><br />
                I am much lighter now, feeling much closer to my higher self than I have ever been. The retreat made me seek out more spiritual healings & I have since followed the path of spiritual calling to learn more for my healing. Not forgetting the absolutely delicious vegan food we get every meal, I can still remember every mouth especially all the moments during our food meditation lunch!
                <br /><br />
                I miss the retreat & everyone I met there & so so thankful to Noel for taking such good care of us. Mantras have also since become a daily part of my life, I listen & sing with my kids almost every day. It’s simply wonderful!

                The biggest outcome I have gotten from the programme was the importance of being myself. Knowing who I am at that moment, being able to express it with honesty and seeing the possibilities of changing to be a better me, and of course, with choice.
                <br /><br />
                Noel has opened myself to be able to see this better for myself and the people around me.
