							<p>Hi, my name is Noel and thank you for taking the time to browse this website!
								<br /> <br />
								Here is my story and how the Akashic Records transformed my life. 
							</p>
							<p>I am born in Singapore and as a young boy, I had vivid dreams of the future. Time and time again, as I step into the future, these dreams turn into reality. I could interact with the elements, nature and angels. They were friends and very natural to me. However, this did not last past my childhood.</p>
							<p>As I approached my teenage year, my parents divorced. I was sad and hurt. I constantly avoided being at home because it brought up sorrow thoughts and memories. In school, I was always one of the better behaved students with good academic grades. However, after my parent’s separation, I could not focus and my grades took a plunge. I failed 5 out of 8 subjects and was one of the worst performers in school. My mum was disappointed and that was a life changing moment for me.</p>
							<p>To protect myself from further grief and to not fail my mum again, I was told to ignore the emotional pain and to focus on exceling in school. By burying myself in work and rationalizing my unproductive sorrows, I discovered that I could numb my heartache. I became a machine. My emotions were so armored that when my beloved grandmother passed on, I could not mourn or shed a tear even when I wanted to. In this state of being, I topped my class and soon my standard. However, before I knew it, I could no longer remember my dreams or interact with the elements, nature and angels. This did not bother me then as I could not see any materialistic benefits. My scientific and logical mind justified that all the interactions with the elements, nature or angels in the past were a figment of my imagination.</p>

							<p>Wind the clock into the future and most would feel that I have done well in life. I won achievements and awards. Was a competitive athlete and dancer. Climbed the corporate ladder very quickly as an investment banker. Took on the role of manager and leader in several capacities and was the owner of an internationally acclaimed conscious capitalistic raw organic vegan cafe and snacks manufacturing business. I was well off, had no shortage of friends or lovers but I felt empty. Where I was in life did not resonate with my soul.</p>
							<p>In 2014, I came across my teacher Ernesto Ortiz and the Akashic Records. With the guidance and support of the Akashic Records, I discovered my true self and connected to the Sacred Divinity within. The Akashic Records reminded me how to be in touch with my emotions and to dream. I could once again communicate with spirit. This life changing transformation made me free, full of love and appreciative of life.</p>
							<p>I left my investment banking career and closed down my raw organic vegan cafe and snacks manufacturing business. Like myself, I am aware that many people are stuck in erroneous beliefs, negative experiences and past trauma ingrained by society and family, preventing them from living their lives fully. In 2017, I dedicated my life’s vocation to supporting people with their transformational spiritual journey and became a full time Akashic Records Consultant. </p>

							<p>Life is a journey to learn and unlearn. It never stops. I am continually on the look-out for knowledge and complementary modalities to uncover more of the diamond within myself, so as to be able to share with others. To develop my heart, mind, body and soul, I practice high intensity interval training, meditation, qigong, yoga as well as work with the Akashic Records, astrology, crystals, mantras, sacred geometry, shamanic practices and tarot.</p>
							<p>That is my story thus far and I hope it has given you something that you can relate to. Please feel free to continue exploring this site to learn about the <a href="./services">services</a> I provide. If any bit of you feels called for us to work together or you would like to speak with me about anything, please do not hesitate to contact me <a href="./contact">here</a>.</p>
								
							<p>I do not know everything, but I know that you can trust the Akashic Records to take care of you.</p>
