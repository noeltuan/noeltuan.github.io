							<p>Hello!<br /> <br />
								Thank you for dropping by! My name is Noel and here is my story.
							</p>
							<p>I am born in Singapore. As a boy, I dreamt and saw the future. Time and time again, I saw myself reenacting my dream. Dreams turned into reality. It was during that time that I realize I had the power to deviate from my dreams. I could choose whether to follow the script of my dreams or to be the director and move in the direction I chose for it to go.</p>
							<p>When my parents separated, I was sad and deeply hurt. I was told to ignore the emotional hurt and focus on exceling in school. To cope, I learnt to rationalize my emotions. I rationalized that it was not productive to be sad or to experience emotional pain so I hid those emotions away and became a machine. In this state of being, I topped my class and eventually my standard. I discarded my dreams as I did not find them useful in helping me excel in school and before I knew it, I could no longer remember my dreams.</p>
							<p>Wind the clock into the future and most would feel that I have done well in life. I:
								<ul>
									<li>climbed the ranks very quickly and took on key leadership roles while serving the military and in school.</li>
									<li>am in good physical condition and have competed and won in middle distance running, boxing and hip hop dance. </li>
									<li>learnt to play musical instruments.</li>
									<li>studied abroad in a private Ivy League research university.</li>
									<li>was in relationships with beauty pageant participants and winners.</li>
									<li>worked abroad in a bank, earned a high paying salary and climbed very quickly up the corporate ladder.</li>
									<li>owned commercial and residential properties.</li>
								</ul>
								But… I felt empty without a higher purpose. This cannot be the purpose of life!
							</p>
							<p>It was in 2014, that I came across the Akashic Records and my teacher Ernesto Ortiz. I became an Akashic Records practitioner since then and through the guidance of the Akashic Records, I left the financial industry to run Anything But Salads, a multi-award winning conscious health foods company that I co-founded.</p>
							<p>The Akashic Records has taught me how to be in touch with my emotions and to dream once again. Through my dreams, it has taught me many lessons that includes gratefulness and love. More recently, it has taught me to work with tarot cards to give myself and others awareness of the past and present as well as guidance into the future. I truly am enjoying the process a lot!</p>
							<p>The Akashic Records have transformed my life. I walk between the material and spiritual world with equanimity and I have made it my mission to share my joy, happiness and knowledge to as many people as I can.</p>
							<p>I have been doing Akashic Record readings for others since 2015 and am a <a href="http://www.journey2theheart.com/consultants.shtml">certified Journey To The Heart Akashic Records consultant</a>. My work through the Akashic Records allow me to perceive emotional states of individuals, connecting me with people and my clients at a deeper level. With an appreciative heart, I am on a journey to gain experience about the world. I am continually working to improve myself so as to better serve the Divine and you.</p>
