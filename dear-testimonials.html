										I would recommend Noel as he was excellent to work with and very professional. Noel takes the comfort and objectives of his client very seriously, and listens closely to what the issues are, and offers realistic feedback on what can be achieved. You do get the sense that it is a partnership, and it is very easy to place your trust in having Noel push for progress and breakthroughs with you.
										<br /><br />
										Throughout the session, I felt his kindness, love, and genuine care for me, and this has continued even after the session with Noel checking in on any feelings and developments since. I really enjoyed working with him, and will be looking to have a further session with him again in the coming months.

									I felt very comfortable and at ease with Noel. He was very patient in explaining what the session entailed and making sure that all my inquiries were promptly addressed. I could share everything with him without any fear of judgement. I felt safe, respected, and cared for throughout the session, and I experienced a sense of unconditional love and acceptance through Noel.

									As a gay man who often struggled with identity issues, Noel helped me to accept myself for who I am, and cleared emotional blockages in my body. After the session, I felt complete, whole, and enough.

								The session Noel gave me was like nothing I had experienced before. This space that he created was so accepting and safe for me to express anything I wanted and I will be eternally grateful for that. Words can’t truly describe the experience, there were so many layers and levels to it but it was what I expected and more.

								Being smoothly introduced to get to know Noel through a small conversation before the session created an environment of trust and safety. I really appreciated his professional devotion throughout the whole session. Being present, focused and calm I felt that he could sense my needs and respond to them directly.
								<br /><br />
								Through caring, pure loving and respectful touch he gave me one unforgettable first experience on what the bodywork is about. I feel grateful to have been working with him and amazed that he awakened so softly such a strong energy flow inside me.

								Thank you for this gift from the heart! The fearful anticipation leading up to the session was necessary to experience. It was a projection of many old stories and beliefs from prior experiences with men including societal and cultural norms, patriarchal structures and sexual assault and harassment. In that sense, the work started before the actual face-to-face experience, in actuality, from the point of consideration to be part of the session. All the uncertainty, hesitation, judgement and doubt that arose were part of the process.
								<br /><br />
								It turned out to be a wonderful collaboration between two loving and fearless beings, which resulted in a further unlocking of my heart and the connected physical body. My heart spirals out joyous thanks for the manifestation of this sacred session. I have been asking the last three new moon cycles for opportunities to receive. For the last calendar year, in deep dives towards healing and transmuting personal wounds and shadow and inner child work...the duality revealed the non-duality; the oneness where the personal is the social. As such, I called for new ways for the masculine and feminine to interact and for the masculine to stop holding on to old fears as we will receive them in love as women rise in their power again. So thank you for this wonderful gift of being able to receive from the space and touch of a loving heart! My cells were flooded with relief and happiness at a new way for the divine feminine to be supported and held by a divine masculine energy that was respectful, gentle and flowed naturally. These are the new, sustainable ways for us to move forward together as a species in this current physical reality!
								<br /><br />
								I was surprised at how subtle the session was, I had no tears or anger but I experienced so many shifts in my body that I am thankful for. My body felt light, free, unbound, shed of an emotional weight I had been carrying for so long... My hip movements right after were so fluid they felt like they were doing figure eights and I felt like I was bouncing and walking on pocketed air springs when I walked! My solar and sacral chakras were having pinpricks of adjustments, like invisible hands were massaging them into divine alignment. Post-session, my heart was glowing and I am still filled with wonder, awe and deep gratitude. <3 <3 <3
								<br /><br />
								I do not feel ashamed, I am proud that I chose to step into this act of deep self-care.

Noel worked extremely patient with me. He gave his complete undivided attention to me, held space for me, allowing the experiences and inner healing to unfold.

He is also patient and actively listens to my concerns, and provides direction on areas which the massage can help to work on.

								Noel has a beautiful soul and when he dedicates his time on his sessions, he puts his full attention and care on his clients. He is an amazing listener that gets his clients, understands their needs, and respects their requests with integrity and love. He is gentle and caring with his touch, very respectful with the body, and is willing to adapt his sessions to his client’s needs, whether this means spending hours talking and sharing, connecting with touch or even just hugging. He is very dedicated and puts great effort into his work. I felt absolutely safe and well taken care of, to the point that I was completely relaxed and surrendered during the massage. I highly recommend Noel’s services to anybody. =) He is a gift.
