									This was my first Akashic Bodywork session with Noel. And it was beyond what I expected.
									<br /><br />
									I entered extremely frightened and nervous and Noel took the time to help me feel safe in what was about to happen and I felt that my emotions and insecurities were all held with the utmost care, love and regard. It was extremely wonderful for me to feel held and loved and cherished in the hours of bodywork and nothing was too much for me to handle.
									<br /><br />
									There was a LOT of integrity expressed in the session and I appreciated that a lot. It was a very safe space and I felt that I could explore my shadow emotions with freedom - something I needed very much in my life today.
									<br /><br />
									All in all, I highly recommend his sessions and his work. Integrity, openness and Love are so key to healing sessions and I felt Noel ticked all of my boxes and more here. I am very grateful!

									Noel is a sensitive, but powerful bodywork practitioner. He provided me with a singularly unique full-body experience that was beyond my expectation. As a straight male, I have not had such an intimate experience with another man, and I found that such deep connection without sexual underpinnings had a distinctly divine quality. It felt as though we were able to transcend our biological identities and become something closer to pure being. To clarify, this was a clothes-on massage without touching of genitalia.
									<br /><br />
									I wish all massages were like this. I left the session feeling a degree of sensation I haven't experienced since I was young. I felt vulnerable, giddy, and very much alive. Thanks Noel for helping dislodge my physical blockages and come into closer union with my own body.

									The bodywork helped me a lot from reclaiming myself as a woman. I suffered from having irregular period pattern. With birth control pills and Chinese medicine, it only helped when I keep taking them. I wanted a reboot for my life and Akashic Bodywork came to me as a solution.
									<br /><br />
									I realized the issue with my physical body was caused by an emotional trauma. The Akashic Bodywork helped me with my problems and slowly rebuilt myself. I felt supported and loved in an unconditional way.

									I would recommend Noel as he was excellent to work with and very professional. Noel takes the comfort and objectives of his client very seriously, and listens closely to what the issues are, and offers realistic feedback on what can be achieved. You do get the sense that it is a partnership, and it is very easy to place your trust in having Noel push for progress and breakthroughs with you.
									<br /><br />
									Throughout the session, I felt his kindness, love, and genuine care for me, and this has continued even after the session with Noel checking in on any feelings and developments since. I really enjoyed working with him, and will be looking to have a further session with him again in the coming months.

										I am writing this testimonial very late but I really appreciate how Noel made it extremely safe for me to express my emotions. I had been following Noel for quite a while and something was calling out to me to get a session from him as his name kept popping up. From the start, I felt safe in his presence. This is coming from someone who had trust issues with the opposite gender and would research extensively to make sure that the healer is in integrity--and Noel is totally someone who is trustworthy and reliable.  
										<br /><br />
										I also used to have problems with expressing myself in such a vulnerable way but never was there a moment when I felt that it was unsafe for me, especially given the history that I had issues feeling safe in this world.
										<br /><br />
										At the start, Noel guided me into doing the moving meditation and I always felt awkward about moving intuitively or following my intuition, and even more so to express my emotions, but he made it extremely safe for me to feel. He could feel my nervousness and tension which is something that sometimes I couldn't feel it myself because that was almost an automatic state of being for me having lived through almost an entire of turbulence and instability.
										<br /><br />
										During the session, I was able to release some of the stored emotions and Noel was a great support with the loving and safe container he held. I am very thankful for Noel's patience for allowing my expression of vulnerability during the session as he held space for me.
										<br /><br />
										I could feel a lot of things moving the following months after the session, I had shifts that happened for me even when I didn't do anything in particular in terms of healing but things were happening that I needed to address and I knew it happened for the reason of healing. I am really extremely grateful and would encourage anyone to get a session from Noel.

									I felt very comfortable and at ease with Noel. He was very patient in explaining what the session entailed and making sure that all my inquiries were promptly addressed. I could share everything with him without any fear of judgement. I felt safe, respected, and cared for throughout the session, and I experienced a sense of unconditional love and acceptance through Noel.

									As a gay man who often struggled with identity issues, Noel helped me to accept myself for who I am, and cleared emotional blockages in my body. After the session, I felt complete, whole, and enough.

								Thank you for this gift from the heart! The fearful anticipation leading up to the session was necessary to experience. It was a projection of many old stories and beliefs from prior experiences with men including societal and cultural norms, patriarchal structures and sexual assault and harassment. In that sense, the work started before the actual face-to-face experience, in actuality, from the point of consideration to be part of the session. All the uncertainty, hesitation, judgement and doubt that arose were part of the process.
								<br /><br />
								It turned out to be a wonderful collaboration between two loving and fearless beings, which resulted in a further unlocking of my heart and the connected physical body. My heart spirals out joyous thanks for the manifestation of this sacred session. I have been asking the last three new moon cycles for opportunities to receive. For the last calendar year, in deep dives towards healing and transmuting personal wounds and shadow and inner child work...the duality revealed the non-duality; the oneness where the personal is the social. As such, I called for new ways for the masculine and feminine to interact and for the masculine to stop holding on to old fears as we will receive them in love as women rise in their power again. So thank you for this wonderful gift of being able to receive from the space and touch of a loving heart! My cells were flooded with relief and happiness at a new way for the divine feminine to be supported and held by a divine masculine energy that was respectful, gentle and flowed naturally. These are the new, sustainable ways for us to move forward together as a species in this current physical reality!
								<br /><br />
								I was surprised at how subtle the session was, I had no tears or anger but I experienced so many shifts in my body that I am thankful for. My body felt light, free, unbound, shed of an emotional weight I had been carrying for so long... My hip movements right after were so fluid they felt like they were doing figure eights and I felt like I was bouncing and walking on pocketed air springs when I walked! My solar and sacral chakras were having pinpricks of adjustments, like invisible hands were massaging them into divine alignment. Post-session, my heart was glowing and I am still filled with wonder, awe and deep gratitude. <3 <3 <3
								<br /><br />
								I do not feel ashamed, I am proud that I chose to step into this act of deep self-care.
