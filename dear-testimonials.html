								I was surprised at how subtle the session was, I had no tears or anger but I experienced so many shifts in my body that I am thankful for. My body felt light, free, unbound, shed of an emotional weight I had been carrying for so long... My hip movements right after were so fluid they felt like they were doing figure eights and I felt like I was bouncing and walking on pocketed air springs when I walked! My solar and sacral chakras were having pinpricks of adjustments, like invisible hands were massaging them into divine alignment. Post-session, my heart was glowing and I am still filled with wonder, awe and deep gratitude. <3 <3 <3

								Healing and life quality transforming benefits that I received from just one session were priceless. I can clearly see that the benefits of continuous sessions would be cumulative. Noel truly is an embodiment of a Tantra practitioner who transforms the people he touches.

								Noel is a gentle and loving soul. I did not realize how shut down my body and my heart were before the session. I was in pain, as traumatic memories were triggered during the session. Noel worked extremely patient with me. He gave his complete undivided attention to me, held space for me, allowing the experiences and inner healing to unfold.

							Noel has a beautiful soul and when he dedicates his time on his sessions, he puts his full attention and care on his clients. He is an amazing listener that gets his clients, understands their needs, and respects their requests with integrity and love. He is gentle and caring with his touch, very respectful with the body, and is willing to adapt his sessions to his client’s needs, whether this means spending hours talking and sharing, connecting with touch or even just hugging. He is very dedicated and puts great effort into his work. I felt absolutely safe and well taken care of, to the point that I was completely relaxed and surrendered during the massage. I highly recommend Noel’s services to anybody. =) He is a gift.
